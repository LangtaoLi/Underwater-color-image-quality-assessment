# Underwater-color-image-quality-assessment
We present an open framework for underwater color image quality assessment based on color cast and visibility degradation measurements. The color cast measurement is a designed based on the specific underwater imaging mechanism, and the visibility degradation measurements is elaborated by considering the information maximization.
